This project is a simple web application for managing a collection of books. It provides a RESTful API that supports basic CRUD operations.

## Features

- **POST /api/books**  
  Adds one or multiple new books in JSON format. The `id` field is automatically generated, so it should not be included when sending data.

- **GET /api/books**  
  Retrieves a list of all books stored in the system.

- **GET /api/books**
  Returns a specific book by its unique ID.

- **PUT /api/books**  
  Updates the details of an existing book by ID.

- **DELETE /api/books**  
  Deletes a book by its ID.

  
This project was developed as part of a web development practice. Each endpoint demonstrates how to handle typical operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using a backend API structure.
